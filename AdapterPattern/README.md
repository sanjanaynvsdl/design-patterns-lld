# Adapter Pattern

## Purpose:
- Allow incompatible interfaces to work together
- Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect
- Enable existing code to work with new or third-party libraries without modification


## Benefits of Adapter Pattern:
- **Reusability**: Use existing classes with incompatible interfaces
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from interface conversion
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension (new adapters) but closed for modification
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between different implementations

## When to Use:
- Integrating third-party libraries with different interfaces
- Working with legacy code that can't be modified
- Creating a unified interface for multiple similar but incompatible classes
- Making incompatible interfaces work together
